	<h1>Premier League news</h1>
	<h3> Chelsea has been the Premier League's<br> biggest spenders over the last decade,<br> splashing out over £2b, but their spending didn't always guarantee immediate success.<br>
 Manchester City's big spending in the 2017/18<br> season paid off as they became one of<br> the greatest Premier League teams, finishing with a record-breaking 100 points and winning<br> the league.
 Despite Chelsea's record-breaking spending of over £522m in<br> the 2022/23 season, they had a<br> disastrous year, finishing 12th in the league and proving that money doesn't always guarantee success.</h3><br>

<h3> Having a strong midfield is vital for a successful football team. It links defense and attack<br>
 and requires hard-working players.
 Luton Town has the weakest midfield<br>
  in the Premier League, lacking experience<br> and proven<br>

  ability.
 Manchester United, despite signing Mason Mount from Chelsea to play alongside<br>
  Bruno Fernandes and<br>
  Casemiro, only<br> have the sixth-strongest midfield in the<br>

 English top-flight.<br>
The key to any great football team is having a strong core in the middle of the park. Whether<br>
 it be two centre<br> midfielders or a trio, fortifying the squad with a strong midfield is vital to any<br>
 team who wants to excel.

The ability<br>
 to link up play between the defence and the attack can have,<br> a huge impact on a side's fortunes<br>
  on the pitch.<br>

   On top of that,<br> the engine room will<br>
    consist of some of the hardest<br> working players in a team<br>, individuals who have to get up and down the pitch to help in all areas.

Several Premier League <br>
teams have made big changes to their midfield this summer,<br>
 with some signing multiple<br>
 players to give their<br>
  team a refresh. So, with that<br> in mind, let's have a look at the starting midfielders for all 20 Premier League teams and rank<br>
  them from worst to best.</h3>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The wolf's body is covered with thick winter fur, which protects it from the cold. The wolf has long legs and large paws with clawed fingers. The female wolf gives birth to 5 to 8 cubs, which at first cannot see, but already have small sharp teeth in their jaws. When the cubs grow up, they themselves begin to participate in the hunt.

Its muzzle is pointed, its eyes are slanted, and its ears are relatively large and upright. He has a very strong neck and chest. The tail is shorter than the half of the body with the head, and it is carried drooping. The fur is yellow-brown with a hint of gray. Gray tones are more pronounced in the winter coat. Unlike a dog, it has a 10 cm long and 2 cm wide black stripe on its forearm. An adult wolf has up to 42 teeth.</p>

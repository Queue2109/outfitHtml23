    <h2>Living space</h2>
    <p>In Europe, wolves live mainly in forested areas, but they can also survive in arctic tundra, swamps, steppes and semi-deserts. In Slovenia, beech and fir trees are the most common in the forests, which grow in the extensive mountain areas of the Dinaric Karst. The pack occupies an area of 100 to 1000 km2, which is 25 km2 per wolf in the pack. The areas of the tropics do not overlap.</p>

<h2>Way of life</h2>
<p>Wolves live in packs with a strictly defined hierarchical scale. At the top are the alpha wolf and the alpha wolf. The pack usually numbers around seven wolves. The size of the territory varies greatly, depending on the number of wolves, the amount of prey in an area, the geography of the area and human access. Wolves are territorial animals and each pack actively defends its territory against wolves from neighboring packs.</p>

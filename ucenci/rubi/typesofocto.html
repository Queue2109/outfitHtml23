		<p><b>Common Octopus</b><br>The common octopus would be unique for its appearance alone, with its massive bulbous head, large eyes, and eight distinctive arms. But by far the most striking characteristic of the octopus is the wide array of techniques it uses to avoid or thwart attackers.Its first, and most amazing line of defense is its ability to hide in plain sight. Using a network of pigment cells and specialized muscles in its skin, this invertebrate can almost instantaneously match the colors, patterns, and even textures of its surroundings. Predators such as sharks, eels, and dolphins swim by without even noticing it.Like all octopuses, the common octopus is very flexible! They can easily squeeze through narrow cracks and small holes. When feeling threatend, an octopus will release a cloud of black ink to obscure its attacker's view, giving it time to swim away. The ink even contains a substance that dulls a predator's sense of smell, making the fleeing octopus harder to track. Considered the most intelligent of all invertebrates, the common octopus is found in the tropical and temperate waters of the world’s oceans. They can grow to about 4.3 feet in length and weigh up to 22 pounds, although averages are much smaller. They prey on crabs, crayfish, and mollusks, and will sometimes use their ink to disorient their victims before attacking.</p>

		<p id="white"><b>Blue-ringed octopus</b><br>Small, but deadly—the blue-ringed octopus is recognized as one of the most dangerous animals in the ocean. Its venom is 1,000 times more powerful than cyanide, and this tiny octopus packs enough venom to kill 26 humans within minutes. It’s best to keep your distance if you encounter a blue-ringed octopus in the ocean. Its bite is usually painless, so you might not know you’ve been bitten until it’s too late. Fortunately, the blue-ringed octopus isn’t aggressive; it’s only likely to bite humans if cornered or handled.</p>

		<p><b>Mimic Octopus</b><br>The “mimicking miracle octopus” earns its weighty name. This new-to-science cephalopod, found in shallow waters of the Indo-Pacific, is a master impersonator, taking on the appearance and behavior of venomous or bad-tasting creatures to foil would-be predators.
		What’s most unusual is the range of the mimic octopus’s repertoire: Most animal mimics impersonate just one animal—the mimic octopus impersonates several, and can switch between them rapidly. Like other mimics, the octopus changes its coloring to disguise itself. More unusually, it can also contort its body to take on the appearance and behavior of several animals, including the lionfish, jellyfish, sea snake, a shrimp, a crab, and others.
		To mimic the sea snake, for example, the octopus tucks into a hole, sticking just two arms out (that display black bands) and rippling them in opposite directions, mimicking a snake’s movement. Even more remarkably, the cephalopod only takes the form of a sea snake when bothered by damselfish—who are preyed on by sea snakes.</p>
